            Why she considered as good? The are many reason behind it...
            <ul>
                <li>actually, i can't think of any reason...</li>
                <div class="description">Finding Joyce strength is very hard! The most profound strengths—resilience, patience, compassion, quiet determination—don't always announce themselves. They aren't as flashy as arrogance or loud confidence. We often mistake the latter for the former. To see someone's true strength, you often have to first see their vulnerability. People build walls to protect themselves, hiding their struggles and the strength it takes to overcome them. It takes time and trust to see behind these walls. In many cultures, "strength" is stereotypically associated with stoicism, invulnerability, and dominance. This can make it hard to recognize strength in forms like empathy, collaboration, or the courage to be wrong. Often, the strongest people in our lives are the ones we lean on. They are so busy supporting others that their own need for support (and thus, their own full range of strength) remains hidden. BUTTTT, the main reason it is very difficult is that, maybe, just MAYBE, Joyce doesn't have any strength...</div>

            Why she considered as stupid? The are many reason behind it...
            <ul>
                <li>She is very annoying</li>
                <div class="description">She always do something not nessessory, just to annoy people...</div>
                <li>She never know when she will 落堂</li>
                <div class="description">This is just an example that she is annoying!</div>
                <li>She seldom answer people questions</li>
                <div class="description">十問九唔答，一答就九唔答八</div>
                <li>She has Poor Listening Skills</li>
                <div class="description">Constantly interrupting, looking at their phone while you talk, or immediately steering the conversation back to themselves. This makes others feel unheard and unimportant.</div>
                <li>She is Complaining and Negativity</li>
                <div class="description">Having a consistently pessimistic outlook. Constant complaining without seeking solutions drains the energy from a room and is emotionally exhausting for others.</div>
                <li>Unsolicited Advice</li>
                <div class="description">Offering advice when no one asked for it, especially in a "I know better than you" tone. It can come across as condescending and intrusive.</div>
                <li>Gossiping</li>
                <div class="description">Speaking negatively about others who aren't present. If they do it to others, people will assume they'll do it about them, too, destroying trust.</div>
                <li>Lack of Self-Awareness</li>
                <div class="description">Being completely oblivious to how their words or actions affect others. This is the common thread for many annoying behaviors—they don't realize they're doing it.</div>
                <li>Disregard for Boundaries</li>
                <div class="description">Not respecting personal space, time, or emotional limits. Examples include showing up unannounced, demanding immediate responses, or pushing someone to do something they've already said "no" to.</div>
				<li>Need for Constant Attention</li>
                <div class="description">Making every situation about them, whether through loudness, dramatic stories, or creating crises. This can be seen as validation-seeking and exhausting.</div>
                <li>Arrogance and Know-It-All-ism</li>
                <div class="description">Acting superior, flaunting knowledge unnecessarily, and being unable to admit when they're wrong. This makes people feel belittled.</div>
                <li>Unreliability</li>
                <div class="description">Consistently being late, canceling plans last minute, or not following through on promises. This signals a lack of respect for other people's time and commitment.</div>
                <li>Victim Mentality</li>
                <div class="description">Believing that everything bad that happens is someone else's fault and they have no agency. This is frustrating because it removes any possibility for productive problem-solving.</div>
                <li>Passive-Aggressiveness</li>
                <div class="description">Instead of communicating directly, they express negative feelings indirectly through sarcasm, backhanded compliments, the silent treatment, or subtle sabotage. This creates a confusing and untrustworthy environment.</div>
				<li>Lack of Accountability</li>
                <div class="description">Never apologizing sincerely or always making excuses for their behavior. This prevents conflict resolution and shows an unwillingness to grow.</div>
                <li>Phone Obsession</li>
                <div class="description">Scrolling through social media or texting during a face-to-face conversation. It's a clear signal that the person in front of them is not a priority.</div>
                <li>Poor Hygiene or Manners</li>
                <div class="description">Things like loud chewing, talking with a full mouth, body odor, or not cleaning up after themselves. These violate basic social contracts of shared space.</div>
                <li>Over-familiarity</li>
                <div class="description">Acting like a close friend immediately (e.g., using nicknames, sharing inside jokes, touching) without the relationship having developed to that level. It can feel presumptuous and invasive.</div>
